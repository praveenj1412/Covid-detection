# Covid-detection
## Introduction

The study is proposed because the serious impact of the disease is still prevalent in this world. Using convolutional neural network architectures, the disease can be detected earlier than with traditional RT-PCR tests. The dataset that has been collected has a set of all chest x-ray images of infected patients with the COVID virus and normal, healthy people. We analyzed the dataset before proceeding with the classification of images through a deep learning approach.
